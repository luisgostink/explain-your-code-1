---

Add your instructions here:

1. Log in into your GitHub account. 
2. At the top navigation bar, under your username, go to 'Repositories'. You will see a list of all the repositories you have created. 
3. When you see the list, click on the 'New' green button. Choose a name for your repository. Better use lower case letters only. If the name contains more than one word, separate them using a  dash ("-"). 
4. When you have chosen your desired repository name, you can add a brief description of it, and also add a readme.md file where you can talk about it more deeply. Also, you can choose to set up the repository private setting to private or public.
5. Then, clone your repository to have the files also stored locally on your computer. 
6. Open VS Code and type Ctrl + Shift + P. Select the second option Git: clone. A pop-up window will appear.  
7. Decide where to store your repository clone. The obvious way would be to save it into your 'projects' Folder.  
8. Now from VS Code you can create the files you need to start working on your project. 
9. In VS Code, go to the left navigation bar and then click on the third tab named 'Source Control'
10. Then go to the three dots at the top right bottom in the left navigation bar. Click on them and then go to the option Branch > Create Branch. Select your branch name.
